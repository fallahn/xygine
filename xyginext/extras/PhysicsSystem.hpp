Physics System class for xygine which wraps Chipmunk2D functions.
This class will wrap most of the boiler plate code used to create
update and destroy a Chipmunk2D physics world so that it can be used
in xygine as any other component/system type. It also exposes the 
underlying chipmunk physics type where appropriate for more fine
grained control.

To use this class add the following source files to your xygine
project:
PhysicsSystem.hpp
PhysicsSystem.cpp
PhysicsObject.cpp

You also need to link Chipmunk2D to your project. Entities which
use the PhysicsSystem also require a xy::Transform component.

\brief A physics component.
PhysicsObjects represent a body within the physics system. A body
is composed of several attached shapes which define its overall mass.
Entities with a PhysicsObject also require a xy::Transform component.
The physics simulation will update the transform automatically, so
setting the transform manually is not necessary.

Default constructed PhysicsObjects are not valid. They must be created
via the factory function in PhysicsSystem like so:

entity.addComponent<PhysicsObject>() = physicsSystem.createObject(position, type);

or

entity.addComponent<PhysicsObject>(physicsSystem.createObject(position, type));
\see PhysicsSystem::createObject()

PhysicsObjects are automatically tidied up, there is no need to manually call
PhysicsSystem::removeObject().

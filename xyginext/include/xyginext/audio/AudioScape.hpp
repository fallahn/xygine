    \brief Contains one or more definitions used to create AudioEmitter components.
    Similarly to the SpriteSheet class used for loading Sprites from configuration
    files, AudioScapes can be used to define the settings used to create AudioEmitter
    components. AudioScape files usually have the extension *.xas with the following
    ConfigFile compatible layout:
    \code
    audio_scape NAME
    {
        emitter NAME_ONE
        {
            path = "STR_PATH_TO_FILE"
            streaming = BOOL
            pitch = FLOAT
            volume = FLOAT
            relative_listener = BOOL
            min_distance = FLOAT
            attenuation = FLOAT
            looped = BOOL
            mixer_channel = INT
        }

        emitter NAME_TWO
        {
            path = "STR_PATH_TO_FILE"
            streaming = BOOL
            pitch = FLOAT
            volume = FLOAT
            relative_listener = BOOL
            min_distance = FLOAT
            attenuation = FLOAT
            looped = BOOL
            mixer_channel = INT
        }
    }
    \endcode
    Emitter properties are optional (except path and streaming) and any omitted properties
    will fall back to their default values.

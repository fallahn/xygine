    \brief Bitmap font class.
    Bitmap fonts are created by loading a font atlas with the following layout:
    10 characters wide, by 10 characters high, starting with ASCII character 32
    (space) and ending with ASCII character 126 (tilde). Some or all of the characters
    may be implemented but unimplemented characters should be left blank. As
    bitmap fonts are very simplistic anything other than ASCII encoding is not
    supported.

    Bitmap fonts are used with the BitmapText and BitmapTextSystem classes. As
    BitmapFonts contain their own texture instances they must live at least as
    long as any BitmapText instances which use them, and should be resource managed
    as regular fonts, preferably with xy::ResourceHandler

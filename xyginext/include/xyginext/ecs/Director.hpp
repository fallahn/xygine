    \brief Abstract Base Class for Directors.
    A director is an 'observer' of the scene to which it belongs,
    and has the ability to command, or direct entities within it.
    While Directors do not exist within the world, they can receive
    both external events, such as player input, and system messages
    emitted from the scene. Based on this input the Director can then
    use a CommandSystem (one of which is automatically added to the
    scene when a Director is first added, if it does not exist) to 
    send commands to entities within the scene. For example a Director
    may take player input, process it then send movement commands to a
    player entity. It may also be used to implement gameplay rules by
    using the events it has observed to decide when new enemies should
    be spawned, where a player should restart and so on.

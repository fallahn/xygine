    \brief Audio Listener component.
    The AudioListener component defines the point at which the
    active AudioSystem hears any playing AudioSources. Only one listener
    is active at a time, by default on the Scene's active camera entity.
    When using mono AudioEmitters spatialisation is calculated based
    on an AudioSource's position relative to the active AudioListener.

        This will affect the perceived volume of all sounds
        being heard by the active listener.
        A volume of 0 will mute all audio, 1 plays back at 'normal' volume
        and anything greater will amplify any sounds heard by the listener.

    \brief Encapsulates a single scene.
    The scene class contains everything needed to create a scene graph by encapsulating
    the ECS and providing factory functions for entities. Multple scenes
    can exist at one time, for instance one to draw the game world, and another to draw
    the HUD. Everything is rendered through renderable systems which, in turn, require
    an ECS - therefore every state which wishes to draw something requires at least a scene,
    right down to menus. All systems should be added before attempting to create any
    entities else existing entities will not be processed by new systems.

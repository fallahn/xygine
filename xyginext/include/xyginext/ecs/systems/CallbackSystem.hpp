    \brief Performs a given callback function on an entity.
    This is useful for behaviour code on entities which aren't used often.
    For example when a single entity of a type exists and is used rarely
    it can mean a lot of overhead writing a specific system and component
    for behaviour which is not often employed. In these cases it's easier
    to attach a Callback component and supply a function with entity specific
    behaviour. Overuse of this system is not recommended, however, as there
    is a certain amount of overhead in calling the behavioural functions,
    so this system should be reserved for specific cases where it makes sense
    or for rapid prototying of ideas that may or may not be expanded to a full
    system.

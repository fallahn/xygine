        This is used to increase the effectively culled area when the system is drawn.
        By default drawables outside the view of the currently active camera are
        culled from rendering, this value adds a border around the viewble area,
        increasing or decreasing the size of the area from which drawables are culled.
        \param size The size of the border. This is a positive or negative value added
        to every side of the active view. Negative values will decrease the size of the
        culling area making drawables visibly culled from the output.

        \brief Sets the filter flags which decide which drawables are rendered.
        Setting this value to anything other than 0 will render all drawables
        which have their matching flag set. As drawables by default are set to
        uint64::max they will ALWAYS be drawn when this is non-zero value. Flags
        must be set on both drawable components and the RenderSystem for the filter
        to work. For example light emitting enitities can be rendered to a separate
        buffer by setting the component flag to 0x1 (first bit) then setting this
        filter to the same value. Returning it to uint64::max (all flags set) will
        once again render all drawable with a non-zero bitmask.
        Generally this is not used unless you have a specific multipass effect in mind.

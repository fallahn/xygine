    \brief Dynamic AABB tree for broadphase queries. Based on
    Erin Catto's dynamic tree in Box2D (http://www.box2d.org)
    which is in turn inspired by Nathanael Presson's btDbvt.
    (https://pybullet.org/wordpress/)

    Dynamic trees can perform 33%-50% faster on a scene containing a lot
    of moving objects compared to a Quad Tree (in personal bench marks
    at least). On the other hand a Quad Tree is usually more optimal for
    a scene with a lot of static geometry (such as a platformer game).
    One or the other should usually be chosen based on the type of scene
    to which it is applied - although bench marking will give the most
    accurate results. Using both in a single scene is generally considered
    redundant.

    \brief Maintains a stack of active states

    States are used to encapsulate different parts of an application or
    game, such as menus or the game state. States can be stacked upon each
    other, for example a pause state may be pushed on top of the game state
    so that it consumes events and input (in a pause menu) but makes sure the
    game state is not updated - hence paused - without losing its state altogether.

    A game or app derived from the App class usually has just one state stack
    to manage any customs states which are created by inheriting the abstract
    base class State. Custom states should be assigned a unique 32 bit ID
    and registered with the state stack.
